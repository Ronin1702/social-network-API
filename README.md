- CRUD Workflow:

>To execute the CRUD workflow for `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` API requests,  please consult the [API Routes](#api-routes).

```js
GIVEN a social network API
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database.
WHEN I delete a user
THEN I also delete the associated thoughts of that user
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a user‚Äôs friend list
```

### API Routes

>Use below param _**end points**_ for API requests when the server has started.
>>For example, in the API tool e.g. [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/), make a new `HTTP Request` <http://localhost:3000/api/users> to execute user API CRUD operations.

***`/api/users`***

- `GET` all users

- `POST` a new user: mongoDB will automatically create an `_id` for the new user

  ```json
  // Example JSON body to POST
  {
    "username": "ronin",
    "email": "ronin@github.com"
  }
  ```

---
***`/api/users/:userId`***

- `GET` a single user by its `_id` and populated thought and friend data

- `PUT` to update a user by its `_id`
  
    ```URL
    http://localhost:3000/api/users/5edff358a0fcb779aa7b118b
    ```

- You can also change `username` and/or `email`, add/remove `friends` by their `_id`s with `JSON` method as follows:

  ```json
  {
    //change ronin's username to ronin1702
    "username": "ronin1702",
    
    //change ronin's email to ronin1702@github.com
    "email": "ronin1702@github.com",

    "friends": [
      //adding two friends with their _id
      "64f3c522f4bb44d360d9dd98",
      "64f3bf3bf4bb44d360d9dd8f"
    ]
  }
  ```

  ```json
  {
    //removing all friends by leaving the array empty, without changing anything else
    "friends": []  
  }
  ```

- `DELETE` to remove user by its `_id`

>**Note**: Associated thoughts and reactions are deleted when the user is the deleted.

---
***`/api/users/:userId/friends/:friendId`***

- `GET` to retrieve a list of all friends for a single user by `_id`

- `POST` to add a new friend to a user's friend list
  - `URL` method: adding `userId`: `64f3c522f4bb44d360d9dd98` as a friend to `userId`: `5edff358a0fcb779aa7b118b`

    ```url
    http://localhost:3000/api/users/5edff358a0fcb779aa7b118b/friends/64f3c522f4bb44d360d9dd98
    ```

  - `JSON` method

    ```URL
    http://localhost:3000/api/users/5edff358a0fcb779aa7b118b/
    ```

    and pass the `friends`' `_id`s in the `JSON body` of the `POST` request as follows:

    ```json
    // Example JSON body to POST
    {
      "friends": [
        "64f3c522f4bb44d360d9dd98"
      ]
    }
    ```

- `DELETE` to remove a friend from a user's friend list

---
***`/api/thoughts`***

- `GET` to get all thoughts
- `POST` to create a new thought (don't forget to push the created thought's `_id` to the associated user's `thoughts` array field)

  ```json
  // Example JSON body to POST
  {
    "thoughtText": "Here's a cool thought...",
    "username": "ronin1702",
    "userId": "5edff358a0fcb779aa7b118b"
  }
  ```

---
***`/api/thoughts/:thoughtId`***

- `GET` to get a single thought by its `_id`

- `PUT` to update a thought by its `_id`

- `DELETE` to remove a thought by its `_id`

---
***`/api/thoughts/:thoughtId/reactions`***

- `POST` to create a reaction stored in a single thought's `reactions` array field

---
***`/api/thoughts/:thoughtId/reactions/:reactionId`***

- `DELETE` to pull and remove a reaction by the reaction's `reactionId` value
